# 🎮 Project: Stone-Paper-Scissors Game

> **"A manifestation of programming logic and a practical application of automated decision-making rules."** 🚀

📌 This project is the first practical application within **[Level 05: Algorithms & Problem-Solving Level 2](https://github.com/ammmrrr18-cloud/Programming-Foundations-Roadmap/tree/main/05%20-%20Algorithms%20%26%20Problem-Solving%20%E2%80%93%20Level%202)**. The project focuses on building an interactive system that combines **decision randomness** with **result precision** using C++.

## 🛠️ Technical Concepts Used
In this code, I focused on implementing advanced concepts to ensure efficiency and maintainability:

* **Structures (Structs):** To organize round data and final game results into manageable objects.
* **Enumerations (Enums):** To professionally define game choices and winner states, avoiding "magic numbers" in the logic.
* **Randomization:** To ensure intelligent computer decisions and apply **Probabilistic Logic**.
* **User Experience (UX):** Implementation of dynamic screen colors (`system("color")`) and audible alerts to provide immediate feedback.

## 🕹️ How to Play
1.  **Run the Program:** Compile and execute the source code.
2.  **Set Rounds:** Enter the number of rounds you wish to play (1 to 10).
3.  **Make a Choice:** In each round, choose your weapon: **[1] Stone, [2] Paper, [3] Scissor**.
4.  **Instant Feedback:** The round result is displayed immediately with a corresponding screen color change (Green for Win, Red for Loss).
5.  **Final Report:** After all rounds, a final "Game Over" screen summarizes the entire performance.

## 📂 Level 05 Projects
This project is part of a series of applications for Level 05. You can also explore the second project:
* **🚀 [Math Quiz Game](https://github.com/ammmrrr18-cloud/05-Algorithms-Level-2-Project-1-Math-Game)**: An intelligent question engine that generates and validates dynamic arithmetic problems automatically based on programmed difficulty levels.

## 🚀 Learning Outcomes
Building this project helped me master:
- ✅ **Modular Programming:** Breaking down the system into specialized, reusable functions.
- ✅ **Data Validation:** Professionally handling and validating user inputs to ensure system stability.
- ✅ **Algorithm Implementation:** Bridging the gap between theoretical game logic and functional code.
